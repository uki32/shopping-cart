To run the app

download the zipped tag, unpack to your desired location, in cmd run commands:
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed to test-fill the migrated database.
php artisan serve

home page url should contain '/products' route in the end of url e.g. 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/product'

this is just an example of my basic Laravel knowledge helped by tutorial.
i also have to mention that technologies used in tutorial were Laravel 5.2 and Bootstrap 3, 
and that my app was built in Laravel 10 and bootsrtap 5.
